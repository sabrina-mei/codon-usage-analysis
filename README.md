# Codon Usage Analysis

Given a DNA or RNA sequence, various codon usage statistics are calculated and visualized in graphs. This includes the following:
- Compute count and frequencies of each codon in the sequence
- Compute count and frequencies of each amino acid in the sequence
  - Compute count and frequencies of each codon for each amino acid
      - For example: UUU and UUC code for phenylalanine (F), UUUUUCUUU would have 3 F's be 100% F, but of that, 2/3 are UUU and 1/3 are UUC
